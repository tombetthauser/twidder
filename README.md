# Welcome to Twidder
This is intended to be a quick exercise to practice getting a fullstack app built and hosted on Heroku from start to finish as quickly as possible. If you want to reset the project enter the following into your terminal then follow these instructions and rebuild!

```
$ shopt -s extglob; rm -rf -v !("README.md"); rm -rf .gitignore .env
```
